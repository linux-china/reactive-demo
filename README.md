### Glossary

* reactive: 响应的，响应式的
* streaming: 流式的
* asynchronous: 异步的
* non-blocking: 非阻塞的
* Observable 可观测的
* Single: 单个的
* Flux: 流量
* Mono: 单一的

### Reactive Operation

* Creation
* Combine
* transform(map,flatMap)
* Filter
* Mathematical and Aggregate Operators
* Utility Operators
* Conditional and Boolean Operators
* Error Handling

##### reactive stream

* Publisher: A Publisher is a provider of a potentially unbounded number of sequenced elements, publishing them according to the demand received from its Subscriber(s).
* Subscriber: Receive call to onSubscribe(Subscription) once after passing an instance of Subscriber to Publisher.subscribe(Subscriber).
* Subscription: A Subscription represents a one-to-one lifecycle of a Subscriber subscribing to a Publisher, use subscription.request() method to request items.
* Processor:  Processor represents a processing stage—which is both a Subscriber and a Publisher and obeys the contracts of both

### ReactiveX

* Observable
* Operators
* Single
* Subject
* Scheduler

### Java 9

https://www.baeldung.com/java-9-reactive-streams

* java.util.concurrent.Flow: Interrelated interfaces and static methods for establishing flow-controlled components
* SubmissionPublisher: publisher

##### RxJava

* Observable: This class provides methods for subscribing to the Observable as well as delegate methods to the various Observers.
* Single: Reactive Pattern for a single value response
* Observer: Provides a mechanism for receiving push-based notifications
* Subscriber: Provides a mechanism for receiving push-based notifications from Observables, and permits manual unsubscribing from these Observables.

#### RxJava 2 & 3

RxJava 2 features several base classes you can discover operators on:

* io.reactivex.Flowable: 0..N flows, supporting Reactive-Streams and backpressure
* io.reactivex.Observable: 0..N flows, no backpressure,
* io.reactivex.Single: a flow of exactly 1 item or an error,
* io.reactivex.Completable: a flow without items but only a completion or error signal,
* io.reactivex.Maybe: a flow with no items, exactly one item or an error.
* Notification: Represents the reactive signal types: onNext, onError and onComplete and holds their parameter values (a value, a Throwable, nothing)
* Subject: Represents an Observer and an Observable at the same time, allowing multicasting events from a single source to multiple child Observers

##### Reactor

* Flux: A Reactive Streams {@link Publisher} with rx operators that emits 0 to N elements, and then completes  (successfully or with an error).
* Mono: A Reactive Streams {@link Publisher} with basic rx operators that completes successfully by emitting an element, or with an error.
* FluxSink: next/error/complete sink to push data to flux
* FluxProcessor: processor
* Signal: A domain representation of a Reactive Stream signal. There are 4 distinct signals and their possible sequence is defined as such: onError | (onSubscribe onNext* (onError | onComplete)?)

#### Akka Stream

Stream process: Source -> Flow -> Sink

* Source： A processing stage with exactly one output, emitting data elements whenever downstream processing stages are ready to receive them.
* Sink: A processing stage with exactly one input, requesting and accepting data elements possibly slowing down the upstream producer of elements
* Flow: A processing stage which has exactly one input and output, which connects its up- and downstreams by transforming the data elements flowing through it.
* Source.single: Stream a single object

Operators: https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.5/stream/operators/index.html#source-operators

### Kafka Streams

https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/streams/

* Topology: A topology is an acyclic graph of sources, processors, and sinks.
* KafkaStreams: A Kafka client that allows for performing continuous computation on input coming from one or more input topics and sends output to zero, one, or more output topics.
* KStream: an abstraction of a <i>record stream</i> of eyValue pairs

### Kafka Reactor

https://projectreactor.io/docs/kafka/release/reference/

* KafkaSender: publishing messages to Kafka
* KafkaReceiver: consuming messages from Kafka

### RxJava VS Reactor

* RxJava诞生早，使用广泛，尤其在Netflix产品中
* Reactor和Spring整合密切
* 在Java 8支持方面，Reactor基于Java 8，而RxJava是自己的API
* RxJava的模型在其他语言都有实现，如果你用多语言的场景化，RxJava的模型更好一些，如Angular等

### Kotlin Extension

* https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxKotlin
* https://github.com/reactor/reactor-kotlin-extensions

### BlockHound
BlockHound(block代码猎犬)是一个Java agent，主要检测非阻塞线程中的同步调用。 我们常见的同步方法如下：

* java.lang.Thread:  sleep, yield, onSpinWait
* java.lang.Object: wait
* java.io.RandomAccessFile: read0, readBytes, write0, writeBytes
* java.io.FileInputStream: read0, readBytes
* java.io.FileOutputStream: write, writeBytes
* java.net.Socket: connect
* java.net.DatagramSocket: connect
* java.net.PlainDatagramSocketImpl: connect0, peekData, send
* java.net.PlainSocketImpl: socketAccept
* java.net.SocketInputStream: socketRead0
* java.net.SocketOutputStream: socketWrite0
* sun.misc.Unsafe: park
* jdk.internal.misc.Unsafe: park
* java.lang.ProcessImpl: forkAndExec
* java.lang.UNIXProcess: forkAndExec


凡是涉及到以上代码，都是同步调用，需要注意，尤其是使用wait和notifyAll来设计线程协调。

* java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch: await


### Exception handling

Reactor for handling error: doOnError, onErrorMap, onErrorReturn, and onErrorResume

* doOnError: executed when an error is thrown and hasn't been caught
* onErrorMap: used to map an error into another error. As it's only being mapped, the error is still thrown
* onErrorReturn: set a fallback value that will be returned if error is thrown. The next operator in the chain will get the fallback value instead of error.
* onErrorResume: set a fallback method that will be executed if error is thrown. The next operator in the chain will get the result of the fallback method instead of error.
